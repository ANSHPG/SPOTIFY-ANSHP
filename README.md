Welcome to the Spotify Homepage Clone repository! This project is a replica of the popular music streaming platform's homepage, created by Anshuman Pattanaik using HTML and CSS code.

The project aims to showcase the ability to recreate complex and aesthetically pleasing webpages using only front-end technologies. It provides a hands-on experience for those looking to improve their web development skills, particularly in HTML and CSS.

The code is available to the public, making it an excellent resource for developers, students, and anyone looking to learn more about web development. Feel free to browse through the code, make changes, and contribute to the project.

The repository includes all the necessary files to run the project locally, including HTML, CSS, and image files. It also includes a detailed README file that provides instructions on how to run the project.

If you encounter any issues while using this repository or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We welcome all contributions and feedback.

Thank you for your interest in the Spotify Homepage Clone project, and we hope it will be a valuable resource for you on your web development journey.
